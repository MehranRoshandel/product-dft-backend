   # Data Format Transformer(Simple Data Exchanger)
---
## Description

This repository is part of the overarching Catena-X project. It contains the Backend for the DFT.
DFT is short for Data Format Transformer.

It is a standalone service which can be self-hosted. 
It enables companies to provide their data in the Catena-X network via an EDC.
Data is uploaded via two CSV-files. The DFT registers the data in the Digital Twin Registry and makes it accessible via an EDC.
The DFT project has two dependencies: Digital Twins and EDC.

##### For installation guide: see [InstallationGuide.md](InstallationGuide.md)

### How to run

DFT is a SpringBoot Java software project managed by Maven.

When running, the project requires a postgresql database to be available to connect to. Per default configuration the application expects postgres to run on localhost on port 5432.

You can find the standard credentials as well as further database configurations int the application.properties file in the resource folder.


### Prerequisites
- JDK18
- Postgres 13.2
- Docker

### Steps
1. Clone the GitHub Repository - https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/dft-backend
2. Get your instance of postgres running.(Create **dftdb** new database)
3. Setup your project environment to JDK 18
4. Start the application from your IDE.
